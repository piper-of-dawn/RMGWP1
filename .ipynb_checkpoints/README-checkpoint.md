### Problem Statement:

Crude oil prices are pivotal indicators in the global economy, prompting extensive efforts from governments and businesses to forecast their future trends. However, predicting these prices remains a challenging endeavor. Traditional methods such as linear regressions and econometrics are frequently used, but alternative approaches, including structural models and computer-guided analytics, are also explored. Despite these efforts, a consensus on the optimal forecasting approach is still lacking (Ross).

Part of the problem in predicting oil prices, therefore, lies in its sensitivity to disruptions in the global demand and supply of oil. A whole host of factors can affect these prices: geopolitical tensions, economic growth patterns, technological advances, and environmental concerns. This complex interplay is such that changes in supply and demand dynamics can be so sudden and unpredictable that oil prices become erratic (Perry). This is because any economic disruption will lead to magnified effects in the current interconnected global economy. Geopolitical events, consumer behavior changes, or a technological breakthrough in the energy sector will instantly and massively reflect the oil price change. A complex web of these different facts predicts oil prices complex, like a jigsaw puzzle.

Bayesian models are known for their superior predictive accuracy compared to conventional time-series analysis. They are commonly applied in forecasting GDP, inflation, consumer prices, and exchange rates. The Bayesian normal multiple regression model with informative priors is particularly relevant here, incorporating insights from the current and anticipated state of the oil market (Lee & Huh). Bayesian networks are ideally suited for long-term oil price forecasting due to their ability to capture complex relationships and uncertainties inherent in economic and market dynamics. Long-term forecasting requires a methodology capable of handling intricate interdependencies among numerous variables and adapting to evolving conditions over extended periods.

Graphical representations, such as Bayesian networks, offer a valuable framework for visualizing underlying probability structures and developing innovative models. These networks elucidate the relationships among variables, effectively handling complex probability problems. An essential attribute of Bayesian networks is their capacity to identify and incorporate relevant features into the decision-making context. This ensures a comprehensive exploration of all pertinent elements when resolving a problem. Bayesian networks provide greater flexibility and scalability compared to alternative network structures and learning methods. Updating a Bayesian network with new data is straightforward, requiring minimal adjustments. Additionally, the graphical representation of Bayesian networks is easy for both humans and computers to understand, unlike other networks such as neural networks, which pose challenges for human comprehension (Ohri).

With the help of Bayesian networks, integrated with far-reaching sets of data on geopolitical developments, economic growth indicators, and technological and environmental issues, among others, a robust model for long-term forecasting of oil prices can be developed. The chances are high that this may capture complex interdependencies and adjust to changing conditions in a way that is more accurate and insightful than available methodologies do.

The specific problem that the thesis addresses is the need for more accurate and reliable long-term forecasting of crude oil prices. Bayesian networks can be applied in modeling these relationships between different factors that lead to the cost of oil, as it is complex and uncertain. Traditional methods simply cannot handle the dynamic and interdependent nature of these factors; hence, Bayesian networks are the ideal choice for long-term forecasting.

Among the advantages of Bayesian networks is that they make it possible to include prior knowledge and update predictions with new data as it becomes available. This adaptability is an essential point in the forecasting of oil prices because, within months, new geopolitical events or technological improvements may easily change the state of market conditions. In addition, since Bayesian networks are graphical, relationships between variables can be visualized, leading to improved human and computational analysis.

This work aims to create a complete framework for the multiple complexities that arise when trying to forecast the price of crude oil and, therefore, to offer something practical in decision-making within the world economy.
